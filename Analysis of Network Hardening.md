# Analysis of Network Hardening

## Scenario <br></br>
You are a security analyst working for a social media organization. The organization recently experienced a major data breach, which compromised the safety of their customers’ personal information, such as names and addresses. Your organization wants to implement strong network hardening practices that can be performed consistently to prevent attacks and breaches in the future. 

After inspecting the organization’s network, you discover four major vulnerabilities. The four vulnerabilities are as follows:

The organization’s employees' share passwords.

The admin password for the database is set to the default.

The firewalls do not have rules in place to filter traffic coming in and out of the network.

Multifactor authentication (MFA) is not used. 

If no action is taken to address these vulnerabilities, the organization is at risk of experiencing another data breach or other attacks in the future. 

In this activity, you will write a security risk assessment to analyze the incident and explain what methods can be used to further secure the network.

## Response <br> </br>

### Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

Three hardening tools that the organization can use to address the vulnerabilities are 
1. Firewall Maintenance
2. Multifactor Authentication (MFA)
3. Strong Password Policies

### Part 2: Explain your recommendations

1. Firewall maintenance checks and updates security configurations regularly which helps mitigate potential threats
2. MFA is a standard that organizations should be using to help reduce the ability that malicious actors have to pose a threat. It helps ensure that the person attempting to enter is the actual person with authorized credentials.
3. Password policies are best to prevent brute force attacks from malicious actors. It is best for organizations to enforce a strong password policy that requires updating regularly.
