# Install software in a Linux distribution

## Scenario <br></br>

Your role as a security analyst requires that you have the Suricata and tcpdump network security applications installed on your system.

In this scenario, you have to install, uninstall, and reinstall these applications on your Linux Bash shell. You also need to confirm that you’ve installed them correctly.

Here’s how you'll do this: First, you’ll confirm that APT is installed on your Linux Bash shell. Next, you’ll use APT to install the Suricata application and confirm that it is installed. Then, you’ll uninstall the Suricata application and confirm this as well. Next, you’ll install the tcpdump application and list the applications currently installed. Finally, you’ll reinstall the Suricata application and confirm that both applications are installed.

OK, it's time to learn how to install some applications!
