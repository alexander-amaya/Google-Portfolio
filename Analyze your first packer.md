# Analyze your first packet

<br></br>

## Scenario

Youâ€™ll analyze a network packet capture file that contains traffic data related to a user connecting to an internet site. The ability to filter network traffic using packet sniffers to gather relevant information is an essential skill as a security analyst.

You must filter the data in order to:

* identify the source and destination IP addresses involved in this web browsing session,
* examine the protocols that are used when the user makes the connection to the website, and
* analyze some of the data packets to identify the type of information sent and received by the systems that connect to each other when the network data is captured.
