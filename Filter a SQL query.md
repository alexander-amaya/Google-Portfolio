# Filter a SQL query

<br></br>
## Scenario

In this scenario, you need to get specific information about employees, their machines, and the departments they’re in. Your team needs this data to perform various tasks, such as running updates, posting a privacy notice in certain departments, and sending an alert to an employee with an issue on a machine.

You are responsible for finding the required information by querying a database. You’ll add filters to your queries to locate the information more quickly.
